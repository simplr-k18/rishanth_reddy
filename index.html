            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                I believe great engineering starts with a simple question: <strong>What decision is this person trying to make?</strong>
                <br><br>
                Over the past 5 years, I've built data systems processing billions of records across banking and global procurement. But the work I'm most proud of isn't the scale-it's the clarity. The <strong>100+ hours per week</strong> saved because teams no longer hunt for data. The <strong>80% improvement in data quality</strong> because we changed how we thought about the problem, not just how we coded the solution.
                <br><br>
                At Baxter International, I built the company's first unified data product by starting with the fundamental problem: procurement teams across 4 continents couldn't trust their own data. I didn't just integrate 10+ systems-I interviewed stakeholders, understood their workflows, and designed a product that 200+ people now rely on daily. At First Citizens Bank, I redesigned core banking architecture by asking: what if we organized data around how people use it, not how systems store it? The result: Customer 360 and 5 other data products that became the foundation for enterprise decision-making.
                <br><br>
                <strong>My approach combines three principles:</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong>1. Start with the problem, not the technology</strong> - I interview users, map workflows, understand pain points before writing code. Sometimes the best solution isn't more data-it's better clarity.
                <br><br>
                <strong>2. Build for humans, then optimize for systems</strong> - I taught myself Figma to design better interfaces. I create custom dashboards that follow design systems. I believe tools should feel intuitive, not intimidating.
                <br><br>
                <strong>3. Measure what matters</strong> - Not lines of code or query performance alone, but: Did this save time? Did this improve decisions? Do people actually want to use this?
                <br><br>
                This philosophy has led me to create procurement taxonomies (interviewing 30+ stakeholders), build custom internal tools (HTML/CSS/JS, self-taught), and design data products that teams across finance, operations, and C-suite rely on. I work at the intersection of engineering rigor and human-centered design.
                <br><br>
                <strong>>> Currently exploring:</strong> How AI can help procurement teams make better sourcing decisions faster-not by replacing human judgment, but by augmenting it with better information at the right moment.

                    <div class="item-title">Baxter International | Senior Analytical Engineer & Data Architect</div>
                    <div class="item-subtitle">(Aug 2023 – Present | Bangalore, India)</div>
                    <div class="item-description">
                        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Baxter's procurement data was scattered across JDE, GME, Coupa, Maximo, Concur, SAP, and dozens of internal apps spanning APAC, EMEA, LATAM, and North America. Nobody had a single source of truth. Reports took days to compile manually. Finance and procurement teams were making critical decisions with incomplete information.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>What I Built:</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>First Enterprise Data Product (Spend Analytics Platform):</strong> Designed and architected Baxter's first unified data product using Starburst + AWS S3 data lake. Built end-to-end from requirements → data modeling → engineering → dashboards → user training. Unified data from 10+ source systems across 4 regions into a single queryable interface supporting 20+ user groups.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Automated Reporting Pipeline:</strong> Created Python scripts to auto-generate weekly/monthly/quarterly reports from Tableau/Power BI. Reduced manual reporting work from 15+ hours/week to 30 minutes.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Supplier Master Data Revolution:</strong> Analyzed and integrated external data systems (D&B, Supplier.io) from scratch. Created matching rules that introduced the concept of parent suppliers and legal entities, resulting in 80% improvement in supplier data quality.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Procurement Taxonomy & Hierarchy:</strong> Built procurement hierarchy models by interviewing 30+ stakeholders. Created the single source of truth for procurement classification across the enterprise.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>M&A Integration:</strong> Led data integration for Hillrom acquisition and Kidney Care spin-off. Worked directly with C-suite on both initiatives.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Internal Tools (Self-Taught):</strong> Created custom procurement dashboard catalog using HTML/CSS/JS following Baxter design standards. Built modern, searchable interface for 40+ previously scattered dashboards.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>The Impact:</strong> 500M+ records processed daily | 40% reduction in reporting time | 94% forecast accuracy | 200+ stakeholders relying on unified data | 100+ hours/week saved across teams
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>The Journey:</strong> Started doing manual data mapping in Excel. Got frustrated with inefficiency, taught myself Power Automate + M365 suite, and built automation that eliminated 80% of manual work. This freed the team to focus on actual analysis instead of data wrangling.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Enterprise Data Architecture:</strong> Maintained data models across 12+ business units using ER Studio. Led cloud migration from legacy warehouse architecture to product-based design. Organized repository with dev/test/prod structure that became the standard across the enterprise.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Data Products I Designed from Scratch:</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Customer 360</strong> - Main source of truth for Sales, Marketing, and C-suite across Commercial, Private Banking, Life Sciences, and Capital divisions. Increased cross-team data usage by 60%.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Investor 360</strong> - Comprehensive view of institutional investors and relationships for better portfolio management.
                        <br><br>
                        • <strong>Loans, FX, Credit Card & Credit Line Data Products</strong> - End-to-end analytics platforms for risk, treasury, and consumer credit teams.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Master Data Management Innovation:</strong> Identified that customer matching at legal entity level was creating thousands of false negatives. Proposed changing matching hierarchy to Parent Entity → Legal Entity. Result: <strong>80% increase in match rates, saving 100+ man-hours per week</strong> previously spent on manual matching.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Cross-Functional Leadership:</strong> Part of Architecture and Center of Excellence teams. Improved data quality across 4 business units working with Agile and SAFe teams. Led governance initiatives for metadata, lineage, and reference data.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Scale:</strong> Worked with billions of rows across multiple banking products, maintaining 99.9%+ data quality SLAs for critical financial reporting.
